# DF-market-subgraph

Really slow , need to find a way to check the fee at the time of contract creation without scanning every single block.  
Then I could just check fee on every fee change instead of also check every single block.  
I must be missing something obvious.

Should show  
  - the fees for each round
  - the tokens listed and their prices and owners
